/**
 * The user is responsible for passing a valid csv sheet.
 * <p/>
 * The first row of the sheet should be a header row.
 * The header for each column should be the character for
 * the transition of the state, the word DEFAULT, the word SPACE
 * , the word comma, the string 0-9, or the string
 * ~`!@#$%?. For a given row (state) the value in each
 * of these columns represents which state to move to
 * after receiving the character in the header.
 * <p/>
 * i.e. if state 2 should move to 10 after receiving an
 * 'a', then the value in the column 'a' for state 2 should
 * be 10.
 * <p/>
 * All remaining rows should represent states for the dfa.
 * <p/>
 * The first column should be a counter starting at
 * 0 for the second row (first state). The next column should
 * define the name of the state. Accept states should have
 * a name that matches the name of the type of token to be
 * returned.
 * <p/>
 * The next column should be the DEFAULT column that defines
 * where the state should go if no specific value has been
 * defined for that state.
 * <p/>
 * The final column should have the value 'yes' if the state in
 * question is an accept state.
